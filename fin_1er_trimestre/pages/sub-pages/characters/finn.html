        <!-- main info -->
          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Finn, formerly designated FN-2187 ("Eight-Seven"), was a <b>Force-sensitive human male stormtrooper</b> who served the <b>First Order</b> until his desertion and subsequent <b>defection</b> to the <b>Resistance</b> during the <b>First Order-Resistance War</b>. Though trained since <b>birth</b> to be a loyal and obedient <b>soldier</b>, FN-2187's conscience conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a <b>time</b> he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping to escape the <b>galactic</b> conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As <b>the galaxy</b> became consumed by war, the renegade <b>trooper</b> was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info">Born in <b>11 ABY</b> during the <b>New Republic Era</b>, FN-2187 was part of a <b>new generation of stormtroopers</b>—human <b>children</b> conscripted into the <b>military forces</b> of the First Order—modeled on the <b>Republic clone troopers</b> and <b>Imperial stormtroopers</b> of the <b>past</b>. He originally trained with <b>Batch Eight</b> before joining the <b>FN Corps</b>, a sub-branch of the <b>Stormtrooper Corps</b>, and although his potential was recognized by his <b>commanding officers</b>, FN-2187 lacked the ruthlessness that had become common in the ranks under the influence of <b>Captain Phasma</b>. In the waning <b>days</b> of the <b>Cold War</b>, he hesitated to <b>kill</b> civilians during his <b>first mission</b> and consequently decided to desert after witnessing the massacre of <b>Tuanul</b>. Lacking experience as a <b>pilot</b>, FN-2187 freed a Resistance <b>prisoner</b>, <b>Commander Poe Dameron</b>, who coined the nickname "Finn" to supplant the renegade stormtrooper's alphanumeric designation. He then sought his own freedom while forming friendships with the <b>Jakku scavenger Rey</b> and the <b>droid BB-8</b>, as well as the <b>Rebel war heroes Han Solo</b> and <b>Chewbacca</b>.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">After the <b>destruction</b> of the <b>New Republic</b>, Finn provided the Resistance with the information they needed to destroy the First Order's <b>superweapon</b>, <b>Starkiller Base</b>. During the <b>attack</b>, he was defeated and nearly killed by the <b>dark warrior Kylo Ren</b>. Rescued by Rey and Chewbacca, Finn recuperated from his injuries and by the time he awoke, the Resistance was forced to <b>evacuate</b> their <b>base</b> on <b>D'Qar</b>. Despite attempting to escape from the conflict once more, a <b>mission</b> with <b>Rose Tico</b> convinced Finn to truly join the Resistance to the extent where he nearly sacrificed his life for their cause during the <b>Battle of Crait</b> in <b>34 ABY</b>. In <b>35 ABY</b>, Finn continued assisting the Resistance by joining Rey on the quest to find the <b>Sith wayfinder</b> and destroy the malevolent religion once and for all, eventually becoming a general along with Poe after <b>Leia's</b> passing, with his first mission as a general being spent leading the ground forces during the <b>Battle of Exegol</b>.</p>
