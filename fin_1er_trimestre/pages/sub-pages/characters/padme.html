        <!-- main info -->
          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Padmé Amidala Naberrie was a <b>human female senator</b> who represented the <b>people</b> of <b>Naboo</b> during the <b>final years</b> of the <b>Galactic Republic</b>. Prior to her career in the Galactic Senate, Amidala was the <b>elected ruler</b> of the <b>Royal House of Naboo</b>. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of <b>democracy</b> as well as a peaceful resolution to the <b>Clone Wars</b>. However, her secret <b>marriage</b> to the <b>Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</b> would have a lasting effect on the future of <b>the galaxy</b> for <b>decades</b> to come.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info"><b>Born</b> in <b>46 BBY</b> during the Age of the Republic, Padmé Naberrie was raised by her <b>parents</b>, <b>Ruwee Naberrie</b> and his wife <b>Jobal</b>, on the peaceful <b>Mid Rim world</b> of Naboo. Despite the humble background of the <b>Naberrie family</b>, Padmé was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected <b>queen</b> and, therefore, adopted the regnal name "Amidala" in <b>32 BBY</b>. Due to the machinations of her <b>advisor</b>, Senator <b>Sheev Palpatine</b>, Amidala's reign was put to the test by the <b>Trade Federation</b>'s <b>blockade</b> and subsequent <b>invasion</b> of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's <b>army</b> of <b>battle droids</b> without assistance, the queen beseeched the <b>Galactic</b> Senate on <b>Coruscant</b> for help, only to see her efforts hampered by <b>bureaucracy</b> and procedure. Although she ultimately <b>liberated</b> her <b>homeworld</b> with the help of the <b>Jedi Order</b> and the Gungan Grand Army, her decision to cast a Vote of No Confidence against Finis<b> Valorum</b> enabled Palpatine to become the <b>Supreme Chancellor</b>.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">Following her reign, Amidala joined the Senate and struggled to resolve the <b>Separatist Crisis</b> through diplomacy, becoming a leading voice in the <b>Loyalist Committee</b> by <b>22 BBY</b>. After surviving an <b>assassination attempt</b> planned by the Trade Federation, she was removed from the <b>capital</b> and sent back to Naboo under the protection of <b>Padawan</b> Anakin Skywalker. Though the <b>Jedi Code</b> forbade personal relationships, deeming attachment, and possession unbecoming of a <b>Jedi</b>, the two gradually became closer as their feelings for each other grew. In the aftermath of the <b>First Battle of Geonosis</b>, Amidala secretly married her Jedi <b>protector</b>, despite her own reservations about their relationship and the consequences they would face if the truth ever came to light. Their subsequent interactions were limited throughout the Clone Wars, with Amidala continuing to advocate peaceful solutions in the Senate while Skywalker served on the front lines as a <b>Jedi General</b> in the <b>Grand Army of the Republic</b>.</p>

            <p id="4th-main-info">In the waning <b>months</b> of the pan-galactic conflict, Amidala revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. As a result of Skywalker's fear of loss, he was seduced by the <b>dark side of the Force</b>, believing that by becoming a <b>Sith Lord</b> he would gain the <b>power</b> to prevent his wife from <b>dying</b> in childbirth. Amidala witnessed <b>Emperor</b> Palpatine's declaration that her fears had come true; the Republic had become the <b>Galactic Empire</b>. After she learned of her husband's transformation into a <b>Sith</b>, she confronted him on <b>Mustafar</b> in the hopes that he had not truly changed, but he instead attempted to kill her. She ultimately died of a broken <b>heart</b> after giving birth to the <b>twins Luke Skywalker</b> and <b>Leia Amidala Skywalker</b>. With her dying breath, she insisted that there was still <b>good</b> in the former Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the persona of <b>Darth</b> Vader throughout the <b>reign</b> of the Empire.</p>

            <p id="5th-main-info">Amidala's children played a major role in the <b>fragmentation</b> of the Empire and the redemption of her husband. Like her mother, Leia entered public service and became a flag-bearer for the democratic ideals of liberty and justice as a leader in the <b>Alliance to Restore the Republic</b> and its successor, the <b>New Republic</b>, before becoming the founding <b>general</b> of the <b>Resistance</b> against the <b>First Order</b>—a successor state to the Galactic Empire. Luke, on the other hand, was trained in the ways of the Jedi like his father before him and was a celebrated war hero of the Rebel Alliance. Through Luke's efforts to redeem his father back to the light, Amidala's last words proved true when Anakin killed the Emperor during the <b>Battle of Endor</b>.</p>
