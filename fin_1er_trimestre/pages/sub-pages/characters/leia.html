        <!-- main info -->
          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Leia Skywalker Organa Solo was a <b>Force-sensitive human Alderaanian female political</b> and <b>military</b> leader who served in the <b>Alliance to Restore the Republic</b> during the <b>Imperial Era</b> and the <b>New Republic</b> and <b>Resistance</b> in the subsequent <b>New Republic Era</b>. Shortly after birth, she was adopted into the <b>House of Organa</b>—the Alderaanian <b>royal</b> family—and was raised as <b>Princess</b> Leia Organa of <b>Alderaan</b>, a <b>planet</b> in the <b>Core Worlds</b> known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of <b>Senator Bail Prestor Organa</b> and his <b>wife</b>, <b>Queen Breha Organa</b>, making her the heir to the <b>Alderaanian monarchy</b>. Instilled with the values of her adopted <b>homeworld</b>, Organa devoted her life to the restoration of <b>democracy</b> by opposing <b>authoritarian</b> regimes, such as the <b>Galactic Empire</b> and the <b>First Order</b>.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info"><b>Born</b> in <b>19 BBY</b> as Leia Amidala Skywalker, she was the daughter of the <b>Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</b> and Senator <b>Padmé Amidala</b> of <b>Naboo</b>. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the <b>Clone Wars</b>, which saw the <b>Jedi Order purged</b> and the <b>Galactic Republic reorganized</b> into the <b>Galactic</b> Empire. With her <b>mother's death</b> in childbirth and her father's fall to the <b>dark side of the Force</b>, Leia and her <b>twin</b> brother, <b>Luke</b>, were separated to keep them hidden from the hands of the <b>Emperor</b>. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Leia Organa grew up peacefully—albeit secluded—on Alderaan until she was kidnapped by <b>Vect Nokru</b>—under the orders of the <b>Third Sister</b>, a member of the <b>Inquisitorius</b>—in <b>9 BBY</b>. Since he had fought alongside her adoptive father in the Clone Wars, <b>Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi</b> went to Leia's rescue on <b>Daiyu</b>, and, after evading the Empire's hand on <b>Mapuzo</b> and <b>Jabiim</b>, Leia was brought back to Alderaan. Years later, Leia succeeded Bail by representing their homeworld in the <b>Imperial Senate</b>, though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the <b>Galactic Civil War</b>, however, Alderaan was <b>destroyed</b> along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the Empire's <b>DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station</b>, causing Organa to openly fight the <b>New Order</b> as a leader of the Rebel Alliance.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">In the aftermath of the <b>Battle of Endor</b>, Organa <b>married</b> the <b>Corellian smuggler Han Solo</b> and learned the <b>Jedi arts</b> as her brother's <b>apprentice</b> until giving birth to her son, <b>Ben Solo</b>, on the <b>day</b> of the Empire's <b>capitulation</b> in <b>5 ABY</b>. Her personal and political life suffered in the <b>years</b> that followed, with Ben turning to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the <b>Galactic Senate</b> sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the <b>military rank</b> of <b>general</b>, she led the Resistance during the <b>Cold War</b> and sought to make amends with Ben. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in <b>destroying</b> the New Republic, and Organa's husband died at the hand of their estranged son in <b>34 ABY</b>. Organa continued to lead the Resistance during the war against the First Order, all the while training <b>Rey</b>—a Force-sensitive <b>scavenger</b> from <b>Jakku</b>—as a <b>Jedi</b>.</p>
            
            <p id="4th-main-info">As her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the <b>light side of the Force</b>. Following her death on <b>Ajan Kloss</b> in <b>35 ABY</b>, the Resistance <b>defeated</b> the <b>forces</b> of the reborn Darth Sidious's <b>Sith Eternal</b> on <b>Exegol</b> and inspired an <b>uprising against the First Order</b> across <b>the galaxy</b>. The heir to three inheritances, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey Skywalker, the military leader <b>Poe Dameron</b> of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only son, who ultimately returned to the light and sacrificed himself for Rey.</p>
