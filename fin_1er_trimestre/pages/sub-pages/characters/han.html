          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Han Solo, known only as Han until being given the surname Solo by an <b>Imperial recruitment officer</b>, and formerly known as Cadet 124-329 while serving as an <b>Imperial cadet</b>, was a <b>human male smuggler</b>. He became a leader in the <b>Alliance to Restore the Republic</b> and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the <b>Galactic Empire</b> during the <b>Galactic Civil War</b>. He hailed from <b>Corellia</b> and became a smuggler, even completing the <b>Kessel Run</b> in just twelve <b>parsecs</b> with his prized <b>ship</b>, the <b>Millennium Falcon</b>, and coming under the employ of <b>Jabba</b> the <b>Hutt</b>. He was the son-in-law of fallen <b>Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</b>, <b>Senator Padmé Amidala</b>, <b>Viceroy Bail Organa</b> and <b>Queen Breha Organa</b>, husband of <b>Princess Leia Organa</b>, brother-in-law of <b>Jedi Master Luke Skywalker</b>, <b>father</b> of <b>Ben Solo</b>, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler <b>Lando Calrissian</b>, and best friends with the <b>Wookiee Chewbacca</b>, his trusted <b>copilot</b> who swore a <b>life debt</b> to the <b>Corellian</b> smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of <b>spice</b> to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of <b>money</b> as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b>, and the <b>droids R2-D2</b> and <b>C-3PO</b> to <b>Alderaan</b>, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Princess Leia Organa escape from the Death<b> Star</b>, briefly fought in the <b>Battle of Yavin</b>, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the <b>superweapon</b>. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of <b>years</b> afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info">After the <b>Battle of Hoth</b>, Solo sought refuge with Organa—with whom he had fallen in love—Chewbacca, and C-3PO on <b>Cloud City</b>, which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the <b>Sith Lord Darth</b> Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the <b>city</b>. Solo was <b>frozen</b> in <b>carbonite</b> and taken to <b>Jabba's Palace</b> on <b>Tatooine</b> by the <b>bounty hunter Boba Fett</b>, where he remained encased in carbonite for <b>months</b> until he was <b>rescued</b> by his friends. After returning to the <b>Alliance Fleet</b>, Solo was promoted to the <b>rank</b> of <b>general</b> and was given command of the Pathfinders, a special forces squad, for the Battle of Endor. Solo led the Pathfinders to Endor, where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native Ewoks, destroyed the shield<b> generator</b> protecting the <b>second Death Star</b> that was being constructed in <b>orbit</b>. Their actions allowed the Alliance <b>Fleet</b> to destroy the superweapon.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">The Battle of Endor, which saw the <b>deaths</b> of <b>Emperor Sheev Palpatine</b> and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the <b>New Republic</b>. In the early <b>days</b> after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He <b>married</b> Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the <b>dark side of the Force</b>—like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was <b>Force-sensitive</b>—so Organa sent him to be <b>trained</b> as a <b>Jedi</b> by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by <b>Snoke</b>, <b>Supreme Leader</b> of the <b>First Order</b>, resulting in the <b>destruction</b> of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the <b>Jedi Order</b>.</p>

            <p id="4th-main-info">Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the Millennium Falcon to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a <b>scavenger</b> named <b>Rey</b> and a defected First Order <b>stormtrooper</b> named <b>Finn</b>, who carried with them a droid, <b>BB-8</b>, that had part of a <b>map</b> to Skywalker's <b>location</b>. Solo, who retrieved the Falcon from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the <b>Resistance</b> against the First Order, and fought in the <b>battle</b> to destroy the First Order superweapon known as <b>Starkiller Base</b>. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with <b>his lightsaber</b>. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon. However, Solo's heroic memory survived and his spirit remained alive and appeared in a <b>Force vision</b> a <b>year later</b> to convince Ren to abandon the dark side and defeat the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, after a <b>duel</b> on the <b>remains</b> of the second Death Star between Rey and Ren, being enough for Ben Solo to return and eventually <b>sacrifice his own life</b> to help Rey end Darth Sidious and the Sith for good.</p>
