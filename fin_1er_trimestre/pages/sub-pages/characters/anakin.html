        <!-- main info -->
          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Anakin Skywalker was a legendary <b>Force-sensitive human male</b> who was a <b>Jedi Knight</b> of the <b>Galactic Republic</b> and the prophesied <b>Chosen One</b> of the <b>Jedi Order</b>, destined to bring balance to <b>the Force</b>. Also known as "Ani" during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "<b>Hero With No Fear</b>" from his accomplishments in the <b>Clone Wars</b>. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the <b>Dark Lord of the Sith</b>, was created when Skywalker turned to the <b>dark side of the Force</b>, pledging his allegiance to the <b>Sith Lord Darth Sidious</b> at the end of the <b>Republic Era</b>.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info">A <b>vergence</b> in the Force, Skywalker was <b>born</b> on the <b>desert planet</b> of <b>Tatooine</b> in the <b>Outer Rim Territories</b> in <b>41 BBY</b>. He was the son of <b>Shmi Skywalker</b>, a <b>slave</b> who conceived a <b>child</b> without a <b>father</b>. His <b>blood</b> contained over twenty-thousand <b>midi-chlorians</b>, surpassing that of <b>Grand Master Yoda</b> and all other <b>Jedi</b> in <b>the galaxy</b>. <b>Qui-Gon Jinn</b>, the <b>Jedi Master</b> who discovered Skywalker during the <b>Invasion of Naboo</b> in <b>32 BBY</b>, theorized that Skywalker was conceived by the midi-chlorians. Following the <b>Battle of Naboo</b>, the <b>Jedi High Council</b> admitted Skywalker into the Order as the <b>Padawan</b> of Jedi Knight <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b> despite feeling that he was too old and emotional to adhere to the <b>Jedi Code</b>. During the early <b>days</b> of the <b>Clone</b> Wars, Skywalker served as a <b>Jedi General</b> in the <b>Grand Army of the Republic</b>, commanding the <b>clone troopers</b> of the elite <b>501st Legion</b> against the <b>Confederacy of Independent Systems</b>. He also oversaw the <b>Jedi training</b> of his own apprentice, <b>Ahsoka Tano</b>, after receiving his knighthood. Although Jedi <b>doctrine</b> prohibited personal relationships, Skywalker had a secret <b>wife</b>, <b>Senator Padmé Amidala</b> of <b>Naboo</b>.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">After Skywalker's faith in the <b>Jedi High Council</b> was shaken when Tano left the Jedi Order in <b>19 BBY</b>, Skywalker learned that <b>Supreme Chancellor</b> Sheev Palpatine was <b>Darth</b> Sidious, the elusive Dark <b>Lord</b> of the <b>Sith</b> who orchestrated the war in order to take over the <b>galaxy</b>. Manipulated into believing that the Jedi had failed him and coupled with his fear of losing Amidala in childbirth, Skywalker betrayed and turned against the Jedi Order, believing Sidious had the knowledge to <b>cheat death</b>. Consumed by the persona of Darth Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marched his <b>legion</b> on the <b>Jedi Temple</b> of <b>Coruscant</b> where they executed its inhabitants, including <b>Jedi younglings</b>, as part of <b>Order 66</b> and the <b>Great Jedi Purge</b>. Vader was then sent to <b>Mustafar</b> to <b>exterminate</b> the <b>Separatist Council</b> at the behest of his <b>Sith Master</b>, who became the <b>self-proclaimed Galactic Emperor</b>. Vader subsequently sustained severe injuries in his <b>duel</b> with Kenobi, and was <b>rebuilt</b> as an <b>armored cyborg</b> while his wife died of a broken <b>heart</b>, though not before giving birth to the <b>twins Luke Skywalker</b> and <b>Princess Leia Organa</b> who were hidden from their father and the <b>Emperor</b> as the <b>Galactic Empire</b> rose to power.</p>

            <p id="4th-main-info">Being the <b>Emperor's Fist</b> and acting as <b>Commander-in-Chief</b> of the <b>Imperial Military</b> despite not holding a <b>military rank</b>, Vader enforced the rule of the <b>New Order</b> as the Emperor's <b>Sith apprentice</b> throughout most of the <b>Imperial Era</b>. In the aftermath of killing Kenobi in their <b>third rematch</b> and the <b>Battle of Yavin</b> in <b>0 BBY</b>, he discovered the existence of his son and was determined to turn Luke to the dark side. Luke sought to become a Jedi, like his father before him, and believed that Vader had the potential to turn back to the <b>light side of the Force</b>. Vader was defeated by Luke during the <b>Battle of Endor</b> in <b>4 ABY</b>, but the young Jedi refused to strike down his father in anger, causing the Emperor to <b>torture</b> Luke with <b>Force lightning</b>. The pain inflicted on his son awakened the part of Vader that was still Anakin, resulting in a redeemed Skywalker killing Sidious at the cost of his own life. Having destroyed the Sith and fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One, Skywalker made peace with his son and became <b>one with the Force</b>.</p>

            <p id="5th-main-info">Anakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi and Sith in <b>galactic history</b>. The Force was especially strong in the <b>Skywalker bloodline</b>, which culminated in Anakin's grandson, <b>Ben Solo</b>, Organa's son who was born by the <b>end</b> of the <b>Galactic Civil War</b> in <b>5 ABY</b>. Solo would turn to the dark side as well, becoming the <b>dark warrior</b> Kylo Ren during the <b>rise</b> of the <b>First Order</b>. Like his grandfather, however, Solo found redemption by sacrificing his life for the love of another—the Jedi apprentice <b>Rey</b>, who heard Skywalker's voice telling her to restore the balance, as he once had, during the <b>Battle of Exegol</b> in <b>35 ABY</b>. Solo's death ended the Skywalker bloodline, although Rey, the <b>granddaughter</b> of Sidious, rejected her true heritage and took their surname to honor their legacy.</p>
