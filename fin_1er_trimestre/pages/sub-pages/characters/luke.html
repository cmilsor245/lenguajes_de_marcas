        <!-- main info -->
          <div id="main-info">
            <p id="1st-main-info">Luke Skywalker, a <b>Force-sensitive human male</b>, was a legendary <b>Jedi Master</b> who fought in the <b>Galactic Civil War</b> during the <b>reign</b> of the <b>Galactic Empire</b>. Along with his companions, <b>Princess Leia Organa</b> and <b>General Han Solo</b>, Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the <b>Alliance to Restore the Republic</b>—an organization committed to the downfall of the <b>Galactic Empire</b> and the restoration of <b>democracy</b>. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest <b>Jedi</b> in <b>galactic history</b>.</p>

            <p id="2nd-main-info">The son of <b>Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</b> and <b>Senator Padmé Amidala</b>, Luke Skywalker was <b>born</b> along with his <b>twin</b> sister, Leia, in <b>19 BBY</b>. As a result of Amidala's <b>death</b> and Anakin's fall to the <b>dark side of the Force</b>, the Skywalker <b>children</b> were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the <b>royal family</b> of <b>Alderaan</b> while Luke was raised by his <b>relatives</b> on <b>Tatooine</b>. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of <b>the Force</b> under the guidance of Jedi Master <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b>, whose first <b>apprentice</b> was Luke's own <b>father</b>. During the <b>Battle of Yavin</b> in <b>0 BBY</b>, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's <b>planet</b>-killing <b>superweapon</b>, the <b>Death Star</b>. He continued his <b>training</b> in the <b>years</b> that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in <b>Grand Master Yoda</b>. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the <b>Battle of Endor</b> in <b>4 ABY</b>, during which he confronted the <b>Sith Lord Darth Vader</b>, whom he <b>learned</b> was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the <b>light side of the Force</b> by killing <b>Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious</b> at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the <b>Chosen One</b>. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on <b>Ajan Kloss</b>, but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.</p>

            <p id="3rd-main-info">With the <b>Sith</b>'s destruction and the subsequent <b>capitulation</b> of the Empire in <b>5 ABY</b>, Luke Skywalker traveled across the <b>galaxy</b>, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the <b>Jedi Order</b>. In <b>9 ABY</b>, Skywalker temporarily took on <b>Grogu</b>, a Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same <b>species</b> as Yoda, as an apprentice. However, during Grogu's training, Skywalker sensed that the child's heart wasn't into relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's friend, the <b>Mandalorian Din Djarin</b> visited the planet bearing a gift of <b>chain mail armor</b> for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice: accepting the gift and returning to the Mandalorian, or taking <b>Yoda's lightsaber</b> and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to Djarin.</p>

            <p id="4th-main-info">Skywalker later took his sister's son, <b>Ben Solo</b>, who inherited the <b>Skywalker bloodline's</b> raw strength and potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. As Master and Padawan, Skywalker traveled with his nephew and <b>battled</b> the <b>Knights of Ren</b>, studied lost Jedi lore, and gathered others to expand their new order's ranks. In <b>28 ABY</b>, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in his nephew, briefly contemplated killing him, causing Solo to fall to the dark side like Vader before him and destroy his nascent order. The loss of his nephew haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. The <b>destruction</b> of his <b>temple</b> and the deaths of all his students convinced him that the <b>time</b> had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought <b>exile</b> on the <b>distant</b> world of <b>Ahch-To</b>, having elected to live out his remaining <b>days</b> as a <b>hermit</b> despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the <b>rise</b> of the <b>First Order</b>.</p>

            <p id="5th-main-info">His solitude was interrupted in <b>34 ABY</b>, shortly after the <b>fall</b> of the <b>New Republic</b>, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play <b>one last, momentous role</b> in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he <b>passed away into the Force</b>, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the <b>Jakku scavenger</b> known as <b>Rey</b>.</p>

            <p id="6th-main-info">In <b>35 ABY</b>, Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the <b>war</b>. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, Skywalker urged Rey to <b>confront</b> her <b>grandfather</b>, the <b>resurrected</b> Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister watched over Rey as she buried their lightsabers in Skywalker's <b>childhood home</b> on Tatooine and adopted the Skywalker name as her own to honor their legacy.</p>
